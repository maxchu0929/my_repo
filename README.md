The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little. But someday the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our place therein, that we shall either go made from the revelation, or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.

- H.P. Lovecraft, opening paragraph of The Call of Cthulhu
